# Design A Slot - Fed Microstrip Patch Antenna Operating at 35 GHz

Microstrip patch antennas are widely utilized in Point-to-Point (P2P) communication links, particularly in applications requiring compact design, directional radiation, and flexibility in frequency bands. Their compact size makes them suitable for integration into communication terminals, while their directional radiation patterns enhance the efficiency of P2P links. Additionally, the antennas can be easily customized for various frequency bands, allowing adaptation to the specific requirements of different wireless communication systems. In P2P scenarios, microstrip patch antennas offer advantages such as cost-effectiveness, ease of integration, and reliable performance.

Furthermore, slot-feeding enhances the capabilities of microstrip patch antennas in P2P communication links, especially when targeting the Ka-band frequencies (26.5-40 GHz), such as those used in 5G applications. Slot-feeding contributes to improved bandwidth, reduced back radiation, enhanced impedance matching, and refined radiation characteristics. This feeding technique is particularly beneficial for achieving better performance metrics, such as a wider bandwidth, lower return loss (S11), and directional beams. As a result, slot-fed microstrip patch antennas prove to be versatile and efficient for applications requiring moderate gains, making them suitable for various P2P communication scenarios, including wireless backhaul, point-to-point links, and millimeter-wave communication.

It's desired to design a 35 GHz Microstrip patch antenna to serve the (P2P) communication links application in the Ka-band.

For any wireless communication, the antenna plays a very important role. The request for this technology is reduced antenna size, weight, and cost with a low profile, high performance, and low return loss (RL). To meet these requirements, the microstrip patch antenna (MPA) can be used. This report represents the design and manufacture of the MPA for the 2.4 GHz applications with very low RL. High Frequency Structural Simulator (HFSS) is used to design and simulation. The proposed MPA is fabricated on flame retardant (FR-4) material as a substrate. The results show that the MPA is capable of dealing with RL of 
-28.11 dB at the frequency of 2.37 GHz on HFSS & -23.876 dB at the frequency 2.361765 GHz in Manufacture Site. The volume of the antenna is 75.85 × 57.23 × 1.6 mm^3.
